<!--
This is an example file demonstrating how to use the shared game UI components
to build a game view. You can use this as a starting point for creating your own
game mode's view.html.

The required CSS classes for these components are defined in server/assets/style.css.
-->

<!--
It's a good practice to have a container for your game-specific layout.
You can add game-specific styles to this container.
-->
<style>
    .my-game-container {
        /* Add any game-specific styles here */
        padding: 20px;
    }
</style>

<div class="my-game-container">
    <!--
    The .game-info-container is a flex container for displaying key game metrics
    like score, time, or round number.
    -->
    <div class="game-info-container">
        <!--
        Each metric is placed in an .info-box.
        -->
        <div class="info-box">
            <span class="info-label">Time</span>
            <span id="time-remaining" class="info-value">--</span>
        </div>
        <div class="info-box">
            <span class="info-label">Score</span>
            <span id="score" class="info-value">0</span>
        </div>
        <div class="info-box">
            <span class="info-label">Round</span>
            <span id="round-number" class="info-value">1</span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!--
    You can add any other custom HTML for your game here.
    For example, a grid for targets, or a specific instruction panel.
    -->
    <div class="my-game-content">
        <p>Your game's main content goes here.</p>
    </div>


    <!--
    The .game-overlay is a full-screen element used to display messages
    that should cover the entire game area, like a countdown or a
    "Game Over" screen.

    Your client.js script will be responsible for showing and hiding this
    overlay and its content at the appropriate times.
    -->
    <div id="game-overlay" class="game-overlay">
        <!-- The .countdown class is for the big "3, 2, 1" numbers -->
        <div id="countdown" class="countdown"></div>

        <!--
        The .game-over container is for the final summary screen.
        It's recommended to have a .hidden class on it by default.
        -->
        <div id="game-over-message" class="game-over hidden">
            <h2>Game Over</h2>
            <p>Final Score: <span id="final-score"></span></p>
            <!-- You can add more stats here -->
            <p>High Score: <span id="high-score"></span></p>
